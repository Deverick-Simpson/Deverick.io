4. **[How they think](https://thecrimereport.org/2020/03/09/854885/)**
	- **Reasons for Riot Forces**
		1. Intimidation enables forces to break the crowd into manageable proportions
		2. Promote violence to shut down protest.
		3. Surround protestors to stop from spreading
		4. Gather evidence for later prosecution.

	- **What will they do?** [Anonymous Mass Protest Survival Guide Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOit6CzX6M8)
		- Riot forces will look for ways to maintain order and disperse the crowd.
		- line charges horses vehicles and less lethal
		- lines will surround you
		- Force to sidewalk
		- Line charges will push to crowds
	- **How do we respond?**
		- Dont stand and watch
		- Spawn gaps and fill quickly
		- Stick together
		- Where do they want to go and get there first
		- Use Banners/Umbrellas to protect yourselves from direct contact with weapons.
		- Protect escape routes
		- Keep moving if they charge. Act in defense
		- Watch for snatch squads. Half will arrest/half stand in front
		- keep crowd moving
		- Spot when authorities are surronding a protester.  Get target out. Surround this individual and let them disperse into the crowd.
		- Link arms in chain
		- Surround the squad to intimidate them. They will reconsider their objective
		- Keep head and arms moving if you are grabbed
		- Dont fight

**Communications:**

1. Use Open Source Secure Communications. I recommend [Signal](https://signal.org/en/). [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) is also popular but is not 100% open source.
2. In the event cellular networks are taken offline, groups can use bluetooth and [Bridgefy](https://medium.com/bridgefy/how-to-use-the-bridgefy-offline-messaging-app-b4799af7649b)
3. Setup Groups to service broadcast messages. 
4. Secure your phone before attending a protest - [Verge Article](https://www.theverge.com/21276979/phone-protest-demonstration-activism-digital-how-to-security-privacy)
